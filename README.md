### How to Use

### Description
preprocessor is a class that can be used to summarize, clean rows, and select features in a pandas dataframe. 
The structure of the class allows the user to train the processor with certain cleaning parameters, and offers 
feedback for tuning. Once parameters are set, the processor can be used to transform any data set with the 
same settings.
